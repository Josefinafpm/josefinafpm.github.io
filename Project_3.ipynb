    "# Project 3: Digital Public Services and Economic Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Governments around the world are increasingly investing in digital public services to reduce administrative burdens, improve transparency, and support private sector activity. Online business registration, electronic tax filing, and digital licensing systems are often framed as tools that can improve the business environment and promote economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The World Bank’s Business Ready (B-READY) project provides a standardized way to measure how effectively economies design regulations, deliver public services, and implement rules in practice. One of its three pillars, **Public Services**, captures the availability and quality of business-facing public services, many of which are delivered digitally.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores whether stronger performance in public services is associated with higher levels of economic development. Rather than testing causality, the analysis uses cross-country data to examine patterns and variation across economies.\n",

    "## What is the B-READY Project?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Business Ready (B-READY) project is the World Bank’s flagship framework for assessing the quality of the business environment across economies. It replaces the earlier Doing Business indicators and places greater emphasis on how regulations and public services function in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "B-READY is structured around three pillars:\n",
    "1. Regulatory Framework\n",
    "2. Public Services\n",
    "3. Operational Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pillar is composed of multiple **topics**, such as Business Entry, Utility Services, Taxation, and Dispute Resolution. For each topic, economies receive scores based on standardized questionnaires and expert assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, **Public Services is not provided as a single standalone variable**. Instead, it is a pillar composed of topic-level scores. Analysts are expected to aggregate these topic scores to construct a pillar-level measure.\n",

    "## Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Is higher income per capita associated with stronger performance in business-facing public services, as measured by the B-READY Public Services pillar?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Economies with higher GDP per capita tend to score higher on B-READY Public Services. However, substantial variation is expected, suggesting that strong public services can also emerge in lower-income contexts.\n",

    "## Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The scatterplot shows a moderate positive relationship between income levels and public services performance. This visual pattern is confirmed by the Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.556, indicating that higher-income economies tend, on average, to score better on public services for businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This result aligns with expectations: wealthier economies often have more fiscal space, stronger administrative capacity, and greater digital infrastructure to support online public services such as business registration, taxation portals, and trade facilitation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the relationship is far from deterministic. The data display substantial dispersion, especially among lower- and middle-income economies, suggesting that income alone does not fully explain public services quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the top performers on the Public Services pillar provides additional insight:\n",
    "- Estonia and Singapore stand out as global leaders, combining high income levels with very strong public services scores. Their performance is consistent with their reputation for advanced digital government and streamlined business services.\n",
    "- Portugal, Hungary, Croatia, New Zealand, and the Slovak Republic also cluster in the upper-right portion of the scatterplot, reinforcing the general income–performance relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the data also reveal meaningful exceptions:\n",
    "- Rwanda appears among the top performers on Public Services despite having a GDP per capita under USD 1,000. This makes Rwanda a clear outlier and a particularly interesting case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rwanda’s strong score supports the B-READY report’s observation that high levels of public service adoption can be achieved even at lower income levels. This suggests that political commitment, institutional reform, and targeted digital investments can compensate, at least partially, for lower income.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis finds a moderate positive relationship between GDP per capita and business-facing public services, as measured by the B-READY Public Services pillar. The Pearson correlation of 0.556 indicates that wealthier economies generally provide stronger public services to businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, the presence of notable outliers—particularly Rwanda—demonstrates that strong public services performance is not exclusive to high-income economies. This supports the B-READY report’s broader conclusion that digital public services can be advanced through institutional reforms and targeted investments, even in resource-constrained contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the results suggest that while economic development facilitates public services quality, policy decisions and governance capacity play a crucial complementary role. Future analysis could build on this work by incorporating governance indicators or examining changes over time to better understand how economies improve public services performance beyond income effects alone.\n",
