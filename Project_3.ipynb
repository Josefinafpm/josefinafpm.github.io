    "# Introduction: Digital Public Services and the Business Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past decade, governments around the world have increasingly invested in digital public services. Online business registration, electronic tax filing, digital trade portals, and e-procurement systems are often promoted as tools to reduce bureaucracy, increase transparency, and improve the overall business environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The World Bank’s **Business Ready (B-READY)** project provides a new way to systematically measure how governments regulate, support, and interact with firms. A key contribution of B-READY is its focus on **public services**, many of which are delivered digitally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The B-READY 2024 report highlights two important facts. First, economies differ widely in their adoption of digital public services across business-relevant areas. Second, while high-income economies tend to perform better on average, there is substantial variation within income groups, suggesting that strong digital public services are not limited to wealthy countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project engages directly with the B-READY data to explore whether economies with stronger public services performance also tend to have higher overall business readiness. Rather than repeating the report’s descriptive findings, the goal is to use data analysis to compare economies, construct rankings, and visualize key relationships.\n"

    "## What is the B-READY Project?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Business Ready (B-READY) project is the World Bank’s flagship framework for assessing the quality of the business environment across economies. It replaces the earlier Doing Business indicators and places greater emphasis on how regulations and public services function in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "B-READY is structured around three pillars:\n",
    "1. Regulatory Framework\n",
    "2. Public Services\n",
    "3. Operational Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pillar is composed of multiple **topics**, such as Business Entry, Utility Services, Taxation, and Dispute Resolution. For each topic, economies receive scores based on standardized questionnaires and expert assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, **Public Services is not provided as a single standalone variable**. Instead, it is a pillar composed of topic-level scores. Analysts are expected to aggregate these topic scores to construct a pillar-level measure.\n",

    "   - Fixed broadband subscriptions per 100 people\n",
    "   - Used as contextual information on digital connectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "The B-READY dataset includes detailed documentation explaining how scores are constructed, how corrections were applied, and how special values are handled. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Do economies with stronger public services performance also tend to have higher overall business readiness?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is motivated by the B-READY report’s observation that digital public services vary widely across economies and may be associated with broader institutional quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Economies with higher Public Services pillar scores tend to have higher overall B-READY scores. However, we expect meaningful variation across economies, suggesting that strong public services can emerge in diverse contexts.\n",
